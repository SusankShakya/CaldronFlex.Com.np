# Dynamic Pricing Engine - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Dynamic Pricing Engine for the Rise CRM application that allows for flexible pricing based on various factors including client type, quantity, area, and custom rules.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `clients/app/Database/Migrations/2025_02_10_000001_create_pricing_tables.php`
- Created tables for:
  - `pricing_rules`: Store pricing rules with conditions and adjustments
  - `pricing_rule_conditions`: Define conditions for rule application
  - `custom_quotes`: Manage custom price quotes
  - `custom_quote_items`: Store quote line items

### 2. Backend Components

#### Models
- **Pricing_rules_model.php**: Manages pricing rules CRUD operations
- **Custom_quotes_model.php**: Handles custom quote management
- **Variant_combinations_model.php**: Integrates with existing variant system

#### Core Library
- **Pricing_engine.php**: Core pricing calculation logic
  - Supports percentage and fixed amount adjustments
  - Handles multiple rule types (client, quantity, area, date-based)
  - Implements rule priority and stacking

#### Service Layer
- **Price_calculator_service.php**: Business logic orchestration
  - Calculates item prices with all applicable rules
  - Generates price breakdowns
  - Creates and manages custom quotes
  - Integrates with variant pricing

### 3. Controllers

#### Pricing_rules.php
- Admin interface for managing pricing rules
- CRUD operations for rules and conditions
- Rule validation and testing

#### Custom_quotes.php
- Quote management interface
- Quote approval workflow
- Quote-to-invoice conversion

#### Items.php (Enhanced)
- Added pricing endpoints:
  - `calculate_price`: Real-time price calculation
  - `get_pricing_rules`: Retrieve applicable rules
  - `create_custom_quote`: Generate custom quotes
  - `get_price_breakdown`: Detailed price analysis

### 4. Frontend Views

#### Pricing Rules Management
- **index.php**: List all pricing rules with filtering
- **modal_form.php**: Create/edit pricing rules with conditions

#### Custom Quotes
- **index.php**: Quote listing with status management
- **modal_form.php**: Create/edit quotes with price calculation
- **view.php**: Detailed quote view with approval actions

#### Price Calculator Component
- **price_calculator.php**: Reusable pricing component
  - Shows price ranges to customers (as requested)
  - Staff can see exact prices and breakdowns
  - Integrates with area calculator
  - Supports variant selection

## Special Requirements Implemented

### Price Range Display
As per user requirement: "The price shown to customer should be in range as we offer different price to different person & org"
- Implemented price range display (Â±15% by default, configurable)
- Customers see price ranges, not fixed prices
- Staff members can view exact calculated prices

### Invoice Price Adjustment
As per user requirement: "At the invoice we have default price adjustable in invoice by staff"
- The calculated price serves as a default/suggested price
- Staff can adjust the final price when creating invoices
- Custom quotes allow for manual price overrides

## Integration Points

### 1. Variant System Integration
- Pricing rules can be applied to specific variant combinations
- Variant-based price adjustments are supported
- Price calculator loads variants dynamically

### 2. Client Management
- Rules can target specific clients or client groups
- Client type (individual/organization) based pricing
- Historical pricing data per client

### 3. Invoice System
- Calculated prices flow into invoice creation
- Staff can override suggested prices
- Quote-to-invoice conversion maintains pricing

## Security Features
- Role-based access control for pricing management
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection in views

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient rule matching algorithm
- Caching of frequently used rules
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading of related data

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)
1. **area_calculator.js**: Visual area input tool
2. **price_calculator.js**: Enhanced real-time updates
3. Complete variant system integration

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Pricing Rule
```php
// Volume discount rule
$rule = [
    'name' => '10% off for orders over 100 units',
    'rule_type' => 'quantity',
    'adjustment_type' => 'percentage',
    'adjustment_value' => -10,
    'priority' => 1,
    'conditions' => [
        ['field' => 'quantity', 'operator' => '>', 'value' => '100']
    ]
];
```

### Calculating Price
```php
$price_data = $this->price_calculator_service->calculate_item_price([
    'item_id' => 123,
    'client_id' => 456,
    'quantity' => 150,
    'area' => 1000,
    'variants_data' => ['color' => 'red', 'size' => 'large']
]);
```

## Technical Notes
- Built on CodeIgniter 4 framework
- Follows MVC architecture with service layer
- Uses Rise CRM's Crud_model for database operations
- Implements Rise CRM's permission system
- Compatible with existing Rise CRM UI/UX patterns
