## Security Measures
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- XSS prevention in outputs
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

## Performance Optimizations

2. **Variants System**: Full support for variant-based pricing
3. **Clients Module**: Customer-specific pricing rules
4. **Orders/Invoices**: Price application at checkout
5. **Reports**: Pricing analytics and insights

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Pricing Rule
```php
// Volume discount for specific client
$rule = array(
    'name' => '20% off for orders over 100 units',
    'rule_type' => 'percentage_discount',
    'discount_value' => 20,
    'min_quantity' => 100,
    'client_id' => 5,
    'priority' => 1,
    'status' => 1
);
```

### Calculating Price
```javascript
// Real-time price calculation
PriceCalculator.calculate({
    item_id: 10,
    client_id: 5,
    quantity: 150,
    area: 250.5,
    variants: {1: "1_red", 2: "2_large"}
});
```

### Visual Area Input
```javascript
// Initialize area calculator
var areaCalc = new AreaCalculator('container-id');
areaCalc.setUnit('sqft');
areaCalc.on('areaChanged', function(area) {
    $('#area-input').val(area);
});
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Pricing rule CRUD operations
- [x] Price calculation accuracy
- [x] Variant price integration
- [x] Custom quote workflow
- [x] Area calculator functionality

- [x] Input validation
- [x] Cross-browser compatibility

## Future Enhancements
1. Bulk pricing import/export
2. Advanced rule conditions (combinations)
3. Promotional pricing campaigns
4. Price history tracking
5. A/B testing for pricing strategies
6. API endpoints for external integrations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Price not calculating**: Check if item has base price set
2. **Rules not applying**: Verify rule status and priority
3. **Variants not showing**: Ensure variants are active
4. **Area calculator not loading**: Check browser console for JS errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in Pricing_engine.php:
```php
private $debug = true; // Set to true for detailed logs
```
