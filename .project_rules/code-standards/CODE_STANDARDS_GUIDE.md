# Code Standards Guide

## Overview
This guide defines the coding standards and quality assurance practices for the CaldronFlex project. All code must adhere to these standards to maintain consistency, readability, and maintainability.

## Core Principles
1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
3. **Maintainability**: Consider future developers (including yourself)
4. **Security First**: Always consider security implications
5. **Performance Aware**: Optimize where it matters
