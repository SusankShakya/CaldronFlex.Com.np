# Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide defines standard workflows for the CaldronFlex project. All development must follow these workflows to ensure consistency and quality.

## Core Workflow Principles

1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete tasks in order, don't skip steps
2. **Documentation First**: Update docs before implementing
3. **File-by-File Changes**: Make changes incrementally
4. **Verification at Each Step**: Ensure each step works before proceeding
5. **Memory Bank Updates**: Document learnings and decisions

## Standard Workflows

### 1. Feature Development Workflow
- Use `feature-development-workflow.md`
- Follow implementation-plan.mdc for tracking
- Update memory banks with decisions

### 2. Bug Fix Workflow
- Use `bug-fix-workflow.md`
- Document root cause in error solutions
- Create tests to prevent regression

### 3. Code Review Workflow
- Use `code-review-workflow.md`
- Check against USER_RULES.md
- Verify code standards compliance

### 4. Deployment Workflow
- Use `deployment-workflow.md`
- Follow backup procedures
- Verify all environments

### 5. Emergency Fix Workflow
- Use `emergency-fix-workflow.md`
- Quick resolution with minimal risk
- Full documentation post-fix

## Workflow Rules

1. **Never Skip Steps**: Each step exists for a reason
2. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
3. **Test Incrementally**: Catch issues early
4. **Update Progress**: Keep implementation-plan.mdc current
5. **Communicate Changes**: Keep team informed
